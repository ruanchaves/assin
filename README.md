ASSIN 2
=================

This repository hosts the code for the model that has been submitted by the Deep Learning Brasil team to the 
[II Evaluation of Semantic Textual Similarity and Textual Inference in Portuguese](https://sites.google.com/view/assin2/english) 
that happened in 2019 during the [Symposium in Information and Human Language Technology](http://comissoes.sbc.org.br/ce-pln/stil2019/).

It achieved the best results among all submissions for the entailment task.

You may also want to read the current version of [our presentation slides](https://github.com/ruanchaves/assin/blob/master/STIL2019_presentation.pdf). A paper and a brief blog post on our findings are currently in the works.

## Installation

In order to reproduce our results, simply execute the commands below:

```
python3.6 -m venv assin2_env
source assin2_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python assin-roberta.py settings.json
python assin-eval.py  assin2-test.xml ./submission/assin2/submission.xml
```

Depending on your resources you may want to edit `settings.json` and increase the amount of workers. Generally speaking, each worker will consume around 8 gigabytes of GPU memory. 

Increasing both the `buckets` and `kfold_buckets` parameters by the same amount on the `settings.json` file is expected to increase the accuracy of the model, although it will also proportionately increase the training time.


## Citation

A paper about our findings is planned to be released next year. 
Until then, you may cite this very repository:
